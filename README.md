# QR-code-Reader
To create a simple QR code reader using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the basic idea is to use the camera of the device (for mobile or desktop) to capture the QR code, then process it with a JavaScript library to decode the QR code
HTML: Structure the page to include a video stream (from the camera) and an area to display the decoded QR code.
CSS: Style the page elements, making the QR code reader visually appealing.
JavaScript: Use a QR code decoding library like jsQR or html5-qrcode to process the camera feed and extract the information from the QR code.
